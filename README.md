### Golden rule: Keep It Simple and Straightforward (KISS)

Keep it simple and straightforward but good enough so it can become a large site or application.

### Install dependencies

- Run `npm install`

### Development

- Run `npm run dev`
- In your browser, navigate to: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

### Resources

- [Generate your icons](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
- [SVG optimizer](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/)

### Publish

1. In `webpack.config.js` file, replace `www.example.com` with the real domain name.

2. Run `npm run build`

3. Copy the following folders/files to web server

	- /dist
	- /images
	- index.html
